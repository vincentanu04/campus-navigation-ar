**Steps to run the app**

SETTING UP THE SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT.
1. Have NodeJS installed. If you don't have it installed, head to https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager.
2. If you have an Android device, I think you can run and test the app on your device, I'm not sure how because I don't have one.
   Else if no Android device, you need to have Android Studio installed and set up the Emulator.

RUNNING THE APP.
1. Clone the repo and open it.
2. Run ``npm install`` to download required packages.
3.
